In this comprehensive technical demonstration, we build a production-ready Multi-Agent Document Q&A System using Python, OpenAI, Qdrant, and Docker. This project showcases an intelligent document processing and retrieval system that routes user questions to specialized AI agents based on content domains.

## System Overview
The system features three specialized AI agents working together:
- **HR Policies Agent**: Company policies, employee procedures, benefits, and HR guidelines
- **Labor Rules Agent**: Employment law, worker rights, legal compliance, and labor regulations
- **Product Manual Agent**: Technical documentation, troubleshooting guides, and product support

## Technical Architecture
- **Document Processing Pipeline**: Automated embedding generation using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small
- **Vector Database**: Qdrant for semantic search and document retrieval
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Intelligent query routing using Agno's Team coordinate mode
- **Containerized Services**: Complete Docker Compose setup with separate embedding and chat services
- **Interactive CLI**: Beautiful console interface with streaming responses and source references

## Key Features Demonstrated
✓ Semantic document chunking and embedding generation
✓ Vector similarity search with contextual retrieval
✓ Multi-agent conversation management with scope handling
✓ Real-time chat interface with source attribution
✓ Dockerized microservices architecture
✓ Production-ready monitoring and debugging capabilities

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.11+ with modern async/await patterns
- OpenAI API for embeddings and chat completion
- Qdrant vector database for semantic search
- Docker & Docker Compose for containerization
- Rich console library for interactive UI
- Agno framework for multi-agent coordination

## Business Value
This system demonstrates how organizations can transform document accessibility, reducing response times from hours to seconds while improving accuracy and enabling self-service capabilities. Perfect for HR departments, compliance teams, and technical support organizations looking to scale knowledge management.
