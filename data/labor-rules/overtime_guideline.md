# Overtime & Night-Shift Guidelines

These guidelines explain how **DigitalBank** applies Brazilian labor law (CLT) to extra hours and night work.

## 1. Overtime Authorization
- Prior written approval from the manager via HR portal.  
- Maximum **2 h/day** (Art. 59 CLT). Exceptions require union agreement.

## 2. Payment Multipliers
| Period                    | Multiplier | Example (Hourly R$ 50) |
|---------------------------|-----------|------------------------|
| Weekday overtime          | 1.5×      | R$ 75                  |
| Weekend/holiday           | 2.0×      | R$ 100                 |
| Night shift (22:00–05:00) | 1.2×      | R$ 60                  |

> **Note:** Night-shift hours are calculated as 52 min 30 s (Art. 73 §2).

## 3. Compensatory Time Off (Banco de Horas)

- Negative balances deducted from last payslip upon resignation.
